Util - functions and snippets for various purposes

This repo is a collection of utility code I wrote for various purposes. It currently contains:

- `etdate.py`: functions to convert dates from Gregorian to Ethiopian calendar and vice versa
- `etnum.py`: functions to convert numbers from Arabic to Ethiopic.
- `et-input.js`: a customized built-in text input element that acts as an Ethiopic IME
